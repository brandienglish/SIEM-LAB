Objective

Deployed an Elastic Cloud environment and configured a Kali Linux VM to serve as a dedicated SIEM lab for comprehensive security event monitoring and analysis. Developed a custom dashboard to visualize critical security metrics, enabling effective, data-driven threat assessments. Conducted security event simulations on the Kali VM to validate detection capabilities, including generating specific threat scenarios. Installed and optimized the Elastic Agent for efficient log capture and forwarding, ensuring real-time event visibility and enhancing security monitoring accuracy. This hands-on experience deepened understanding of threat detection,log management,analysis, system and network awareness.
